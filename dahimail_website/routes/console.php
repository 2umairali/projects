// Hostinger / shared-host friendly worker pattern:
//   --stop-when-empty: worker exits as soon as the queue is drained (usually
//     within 1-2s) so it never holds a long-running PHP process. The next
//     cron tick fires a fresh worker that picks up any new jobs.
//   --max-time=45:    hard upper bound well below the 60s shared-host kill
//     window, so even a backed-up queue never leaves a zombie process.
//   --tries=3:        matches the jobs' own retry count.
// The key fix for "scheduled email not sending" was removing the 10-min
// jobs-table wipe below, NOT keeping workers alive longer.

// ── Worker 1: user-facing send/reply/undo-send ──
// NO withoutOverlapping() — on shared hosts the PHP process gets killed before
// Laravel's schedule:finish fires, which leaves the mutex lock held for a full
// 24 hours (its default expiry) and no subsequent worker can ever start. The
// database queue driver already locks individual job rows with FOR UPDATE so
// two concurrent workers can't double-process the same job. Safer to let them
// run in parallel than to risk a silent 24h outage.
